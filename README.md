# PostHog Community Plugin: Unduplicates

This plugin helps prevent duplicate events from being ingested into PostHog. It's particularly helpful if you're backfilling information as you're already ingesting ongoing events. The plugin scopes duplicates for each individual project. The plugin has two modes.

-   **Event and Timestamp**. An event will be treated as duplicate if the timestamp, event name, user's distinct ID matches exactly (in the scope of each project), regardless of what properties are included.
-   **All Properties**. An event will be treated as duplicate only all properties match exactly, as well as the timestamp, event name, user's distinct ID.

The plugin uses temporary cache to perform faster checks and uses PostHog's API to check if duplicate events have already been ingested.

## üöÄ Usage
